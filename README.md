**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**  
Testing plays a big role in this. Part of that is making sure you are working from a list of clear and well-defined requirements. To ensure that my code is functional I would always test its functionality against the requirements. To ensure that my code is secure I would try to find areas where it is or could potentially be insecure.  
  
**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
When developing for an end user one should use whatever data they have available to interpret what the end user may like or dislike. The best sort of data is direct communication, and if an end user or other client is involved in the development process communications should be open, multiple, and thorough to ensure that requirements are from then on well-defined.  
  
**How do I approach designing software?**
The way I approach software development is through a mixture of inspiration, research, debugging, integration, and refactoring. I get inspired to create, do any necessary research, and then debug as I program. Last, I integrate different parts of modular code and refactor to keep it clean and efficient.
